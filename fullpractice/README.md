Welcome to full practice on some concepts of *args and **kwargs

- Here, we are exploring how to use the *args & **kwargs inside our functions.
- When calling a function, you can use *args and **kwargs to pass arguments.

- We can use the special syntax of *args and **kwargs within a function definition in order to pass a variable number of arguments to the function.

- Creating functions that accept *args and **kwargs are best used in situations where you expect that the number of inputs within the argument list will remain relatively small.
- The use of *args and **kwargs is primarily to provide readability and convenience, but should be done with care.
